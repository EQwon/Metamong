Well, well, ... so we meet again. I see that you've finally defeated every monster in this place.
... Why I'm here? To make you an offer you can't refuse, of course.
I presume you've heard about the plot―what these "monsters" really were...
...
Why should you give your life for this ungrateful kingdom?
END
