... ... Dammit, and I thought it'd be safe here.
You... Do you have any idea what you are doing?
Just take a look. All those monsters you've killed... they're human, like me.
To think we were so prepared, dozens of warriors in every level... god, you're a monster.
No wonder the court wants to get rid of you.

Yeah, orders from the king himself. A power like you is just another threat to the throne.
Don't you see? Sending you here, those contracts... it was all part of the plan.
It woud have been so much easier if you just fell for it.
END
With the demon gone, why should we need a hero like you?
